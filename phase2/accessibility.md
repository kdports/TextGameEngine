Equitable Use:
Integration of themes avoids segregating users by allowing them to switch visual style
GUI is easy to understand and intuitive, so therefore avoids separating users by their ability to understand the program
However, future features (such as a text to speech interface) could be implemented to help blind users

Flexibility in Use:
The save and load features provide adaptability to the user’s pace by allowing them to take their time creating a game
There is no difference between left-handed and right handed use for our program
GUI allows for fluctuations in user accuracy and precision due to the buttons’ clickboxes exceeding their sprites.
Since the program runs without issue on both Windows and Mac it provides choice in method of use

Simple and Intuitive Use:
Our GUI refactoring in phase 1 and 2 removed unnecessary complexity through simplifying it and expanding its size
Each button is clearly labeled, so the program is therefore consistent with user expectation
Information is arranged consistent with its importance through the size of our GUI buttons. The edit button for the decisions is bigger than the connector buttons, and the text entry section for slides is bigger than the set first slide button
While the labels help our GUI, a lack of superfluous text makes it easy for users with low English literacy to understand the program

Perceptible Information:
Our use of themes provides adequate contrast between information and its surroundings
The size of important buttons and GUI features maximizes the legibility of important information
The use of scroll bars gives compatibility to different sized screens that may be used by people with sensory limits

Tolerance for Error:
Hazardous elements are hidden in separate GUI menus. Users must open a new window in order to delete a decision, which shields them from serious accidents
Error boxes appear if the user tries to create a malformed game. The error boxes contain a clear description of potential problems with the user’s game and give ways to fix them
Saving the game uses the normal windows/mac OS saving process in order to discourage unconscious action. If the user were to attempt to overwrite a save file their computer would warn them of their action first

Low Physical Effort:
Every feature in this program can be used with only one hand. Most features only require moving the mouse and left clicking. Only entering text requires the keyboard.
Physical effort is minimized through the prevalence of one-click buttons
Repetitive actions are minimized through the implementation of a playtest button - instead of having to exit out of the studio to launch the gamerenderer users can launch the gamerenderer directly
A future feature could reduce physical effort through making the line connections between decisions and slides require two clicks instead of a dragging motion.

Size and Space for Approach and Use:
This principle does not apply to our program. Our program operates on a computer monitor and does not modify any aspects of the computer relating to screen resolution.
The size and space constraints of the user’s computer will apply to our program. However, the size and space benefits presented by a user’s computer will also apply to our program.


Our program would be marketed towards people who play games and are interested in creating their own. The core demographic would most likely be gamers who have little to no coding experience and are looking to begin game development without having to learn a programming language. However, it would also be useful for programmers who wish to make a text-based game as well. The open-source nature of our project would invite experienced users to contribute to its development.

Our program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Certain significant disabilities, such as blindness or significant mental impairments, would make it far more difficult to use our program. Additionally, any demographic that has no interest in video games would be incredibly unlikely to use our program, since its sole focus is to create and play video games.
