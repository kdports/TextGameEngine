# TextGameEngine
A repo for the creation of the CSC207 group project - a text based game engine.

Running the main method of src/main/java/client/DisplayGame/GameRenderer.java in an IDE will 
display a simple test game in a new window

Running the src/main/java/client/Main.java class will launch the game engine in which you can make the game in. 
To create slides you can use the add slide button in the top right corner. And to add decisions to link the slide 
you would add a decision from a slide and drag the unconnected yellow anchor to another slide by drag clicking your
mouse on the yellow anchor to another slide. 

To playtest the game you must set a slide to be the first slide by pressing edit slide on a slide and choosing set as first slide
and there must be a valid game created or else there will be an error thrown.

You can load the GameProject.ttl file in the phase 1 folder to get a working created game in the game engine to test
