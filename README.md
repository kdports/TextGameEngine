# TextGameEngine
A repo for the creation of the CSC207 group project - a text based game engine.

Running the main method of src/main/java/client/GameRenderer.java in an IDE will 
display a simple test game in a new window

In the future, running the main method of src/main/java/rdf/RDFLoadToPlayer.java will load a preset
RDF file into a playable game using gamerenderer. The code is currently WIP and commented out.

Running the main method of src/main/java/client/GUIBoxScene.java will create a new 
window to build a game in.
